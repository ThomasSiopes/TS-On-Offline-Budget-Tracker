# TS-On-Offline-Budget-Tracker

This project is a budget tracking app that's designed to allow the user to keep track of a history of financial transactions. It generates a chart that displays the user's financial growth between transactions, as well as showing the user their current balance.

The application uses a server to connect a basic index html page to a mongoose database, which uses transaction.js as a data model to create transactions based on the user's input.

The majority of the files within this project are reused from the student mini-project of week 18-NoSQL from the UNH Bootcamp. Files that were notably edited are:
- server.js
- index.js
- db.js
